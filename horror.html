    <h1><b>DOOM 3</b></h1>
    <p>This game had a more atmospheric gameplay and strived to be different from the fast paced gameplay of the <br>
        other 2 games. <br>
    Doom 3 is VERY different from the other 2 games. It's not wrong to say this game is just a horror shooter.<br>
    The game is dark and dingy and has occasional jumpscares throught its many futuristic levels in the facility. <br> 
    <b>About the Game</b><br>
    This game does not follow our original Doomguy, rather it follows a new marine which works at a UAC facility on Mars. <br>
    A demonic invasion occurs while the marine is working here. This is all the detail I'll be going into for the plot. <br>
    You can read the rest of the plot by scrolling down on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_3" target="_blank">this page.</a><br>
    A re-release of Doom 3 called Doom 3: BFG Edition, published by Bethesda Softworks, was released on October 15, 2012 in<br>
    Australia, October 16, 2012 in North America, and October 19, 2012 in Europe. It features enhanced graphics, better<br>
    sound with more horror effects, a checkpoint save system, support for 3D displays and HMDs, and the ability to use the<br>
    flashlight while holding a weapon, in the form of a so-called "armor-mounted flashlight". Also included are the previous<br>
    expansion pack Resurrection of Evil, a new single-player expansion called The Lost Mission, and copies of the original Doom<br>
    (the Ultimate Doom edition with the add-on fourth episode Thy Flesh Consumed) and Doom II (with the expansion <br>
    No Rest for the Living, previously available only for the Xbox 360). <br>
