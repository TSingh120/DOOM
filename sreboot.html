    <h1><b>DOOM 2016</b></h1>
    <p>This game was a reboot and a massive success for Doom. It was fast paced but carried the vibe of original games <br>
    despite being reinvented. It's pretty decently fact paced and atmospheric. It still is a good game to this day.<br>
    This game brought the Doom franchise back into the mainstream. I won't go into detail now because I'm genuinely running <br>
    out of time right now. But you can watch videos about the lore of the entire series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp7hOqcIT84" target="_blank"><b>here.</b></a><br></p><br>

    <h1><b>DOOM ETERNAL</b></h1>
    <p>I think this is the best DOOM game ever. One of the best games period. I love this game so much (I've never played it).<br>
    This game pulled everyone back to DOOM after DOOM 2016 brought it back to light. Its gameplay flips everything the player <br>
    knows from the previous installment on its head. It is insanely fast paced and has a huge skill ceiling. You have to learn to <br>
    manage every single resource you have. It can get VERY hard if you don't play this game right. It has 2 expansion packs after <br>
    base game, The Ancient Gods part 1 and 2. These expand on the game and the story. Here's a speedrun of the base game which <br>
    dsiplays just how good a player can get.<br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EM0HtsZeTo" target="_blank">Speedrun :D</a></p>
