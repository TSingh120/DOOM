    <h1><b>The DOOM Games</b></h1>
    <p>This website is designed to introduce people to Doom and its many games.<br>
        The main protagonist of the Doom franchise is the character with many names.
        Some people refer to him as the Doom Guy,<br> some call him the Doom Slayer. 
        The main premise of this series is our protagonist killing demons who have invaded
        Earth in the future. <br>
        This franchise can be split into 3 types on the basis of its... eras, I'd say.
        Though the mobile doom games were developed in almost all eras.<br>
        Here's a wiki page if you need more info :D.<br>
